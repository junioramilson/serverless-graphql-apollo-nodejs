# Serverless GraphQL Apollo Server

This is a basic template for building serverless graphql apollo server with Lambda and Node.js. As it is a very basic template, maybe it will not run by default, you'll need to setup another configurations like resolvers and schemas.

Maybe in the future this will become a more complex template with some query/mutation examples.
